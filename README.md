# Agent Development Kit (ADK) examples

Repo with example code for building various types of agents using [ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)


1. Simple [Weather and Time agent](./weather_time_agent/) that uses [function tools](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/function-tools/) to find latitude & longitude of a given city, country and its weather and time (timezone-adjusted).  Uses sub-agents to handle specific tasks, each with its own persona.  You can find a short write-up of it on my [Medium](https://medium.com/google-cloud/getting-started-with-agent-development-kit-function-tools-3f038ee646ea).
